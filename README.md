# Web Programming Workshop

## What is this?
This repository is both the syllabus and course materials for RISD’s Fall 2022 Web Programming workshop, a 4-week course that gives graphic designs students a foundation in programming and web design. The repository is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and lives as a website that students can access by going to [gabrieldrozdov.github.io/wpw22](https://gabrieldrozdov.github.io/wpw22/).

## How can I use this repository?
### Current students
During our weekly class meetings, we’ll go through the lectures, tutorials, and workshops relevant to that week. Demos can be found in the folder for the relevant week. You can also access demos via the main syllabus website.
### Anyone else
Start by going to [gabrieldrozdov.github.io/wpw22](https://gabrieldrozdov.github.io/wpw22/). This page will serve as a hub to all of the course’s materials, including lectures and demos. The syllabus and weekly agendas provide guidance on how to make your way through the course if you’d like to follow along.
### Can I use any of these materials in my own Web Programming course?
Absolutely! Please give credit if you take any materials from me directly, or if you take any materials that I have borrowed in creating this course.

## Who made this?
The course and site were designed and developed fully by Gabriel Drozdov (me!). The font featured on the site is Red Hat, designed by Jeremy Mickel.
